* 1st exercise 
    * Create LinearArray class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers and integer)
        * method to insert an element at the beginning of the array
        * method to insert an element at the end of the array
        * method to delete an element from an array
        * method to search for an element in an array
        * method to display all array elements
* 2nd exercise 
    * Create Students class
        * 3 instance variables (String firstName, String lastName and integer ID)
    * Create LinearArrayStudents class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers and integer)
        * method to insert a student at the beginning of the array
        * method to insert a student at the end of the array
        * method to delete a student from an array
        * method to search for an element in an array
        * method to display all array elements
* 3rd exercise
	* Create LinearSortedArray class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers, integer)
        * method to insert an element in an ordered array
        * method to display all array elements
        * method to search for an element in an ordered array
            * iteratively
            * recursively
            * classic
        * method to delete an element from the ordered array
