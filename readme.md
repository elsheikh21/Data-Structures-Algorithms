* 1st exercise 
    * Create LinearArray class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers and integer)
        * method to insert an element at the beginning of the array
        * method to insert an element at the end of the array
        * method to delete an element from an array
        * method to search for an element in an array
        * method to display all array elements
* 2nd exercise 
    * Create Students class
        * 3 instance variables (String firstName, String lastName and integer ID)
    * Create LinearArrayStudents class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers and integer)
        * method to insert a student at the beginning of the array
        * method to insert a student at the end of the array
        * method to delete a student from an array
        * method to search for an element in an array
        * method to display all array elements
* 3rd exercise
	* Create LinearSortedArray class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers, integer)
        * method to insert an element in an ordered array
        * method to display all array elements
        * method to search for an element in an ordered array
            * iteratively
            * recursively
            * classic
        * method to delete an element from the ordered array

<summary>Stacks</summary>

* Implement ArrayStack class
* 1st exercise
	* Method to check the parenthese are matching or not
* 2nd exercise 
    * Search in a stack internal method
    * Search in a stack external method
    * display all stack elements
* 3rd exercise 
    *  Stack decompose method into stack of even no. and other for odd no.
* 4th exercise
	* stack sorting asc
* 5th exercise 
	* Cube game check, if the first half is equal to 2nd half of stack
* 6th exercise
	* Reverse a stack internally
	* Reverse a stack externally 
		* destroy original stack
		* keep original stack
		* return original stack reversed
* 7th exercise 
	* Remove elements starting from nth element
	* Remove elements the nth element
* 8th exercise
	* Sort a stack desc
