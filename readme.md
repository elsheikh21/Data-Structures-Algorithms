        * method to delete an element from an array
        * method to search for an element in an array
        * method to display all array elements
* 2nd exercise 
    * Create Students class
        * 3 instance variables (String firstName, String lastName and integer ID)

<summary>5. Priority Queues</summary>

* 1st Exercise 
    * implement YoghutProduct.class & SuperMarket.class
