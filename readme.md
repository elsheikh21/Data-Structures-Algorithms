* First exercise 
    * Create LinearArray class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers and integer)
        * method to insert an element at the beginning of the array
        * method to insert an element at the end of the array
        * method to delete an element from an array
        * method to search for an element in an array
* Second exercise 
    * Create Students class
        * 3 instance variables (String firstName, String lastName and integer ID)
    * Create LinearArrayStudents class
        * 2 instance variables (array of integers and integer)
        * method to insert a student at the beginning of the array
        * method to insert a student at the end of the array
        * method to delete a student from an array
        * method to search for an element in an array
* Third exercise
	* Create LinearSortedArray class
        * method to insert an element in an ordered array
